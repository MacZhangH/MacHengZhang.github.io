## Board Interlock Networks and Corporate OFDI: A Perspective From China  
**With Ruifeng Zhao, and Dianchun Jiang**  
*Abstract:*  
In this paper, we examine the impact of board governance on firms' OFDI activities after constructing a directed director network among firms by utilizing the unique chain director system of listed firms. We identify the causal relationship between director network centrality and firms' OFDI in our study through lagged 1-period and 2-period regressions of the core explanatory variables and IV-Probit and IV-Tobit estimation using HLW networks as instrumental variables. It is found that the higher the director network centrality, the probability and scale of firms' OFDI expand.

In the mechanism test section, we focus on the two basic board functions of consulting and advising and monitoring, and explore the specific mechanisms by which director network centrality affects corporate OFDI. This paper obtains the following conclusions:

1. Chain directors can improve the decision quality of long-term strategic planning of enterprises with the help of information in the social network, which enables enterprises to form the competitive advantages required to carry out OFDI, such as tangible assets, intangible assets and ESG.  
2. The experience accumulated by chain directors in the decision-making process of different enterprises and projects helps to improve the efficiency of enterprises to carry out large-scale overseas investment to regions with high institutional and information uncertainty.  
3. The reputational governance effect and the resources embedded in the network of directors help chain directors to strengthen the supervision of managers from both internal and external directions, which lays a good governance foundation for enterprises to carry out OFDI.  
4. We provide further evidence for the effectiveness of reputational governance and strategic advice after distinguishing the direction of director networks in the particular scenario of the degree of stability of corporate executives.  

In the final extension test of this paper, we construct an indicator of overseas investment “knowledge” in the director network and test the direct effect of “knowledge spillover” from the director network on corporate OFDI, and find that the more “knowledge” the affiliates have about overseas investment, the more effective they are in terms of governance. We find that the richer the “knowledge” of associated enterprises' overseas investment, the higher the probability and the larger the scale of the focal firm's OFDI; at the same time, this “knowledge” also helps the focal firms to cross-country accumulate knowledge in the early stage of the process, and to invest directly in the host countries where the institutional environment is more complete.

## OFDI and Firms' Investment Sensitivity to Stock Price  
**With Ruifeng Zhao, Jundong Zhang, and Dianchun Jiang**  
*Abstract:*  
This paper tries to address the underperformance of Chinese firms’ investment efficiency. Using the investment-to-stock price sensitivity, we examine the impact of OFDI on corporate investment efficiency. Empirically, corporate investment tends to have a higher sensitivity to the stock price after undertaking OFDI, indicating a higher investment efficiency. Possible mechanisms include governance learning and information horizon effects, which can reduce the adverse effects of the agency problem and information uncertainty on investment efficiency. Moreover, entry mode, internal governance quality, and information integration capability can vary the impact of OFDI. Our main conclusion remains unchanged after adopting a series of robustness tests.

## Trade and Welfare Effects of APEC  
**With Wei Jin**  
*Abstract:*  
This paper evaluates the direct trade effect and general trade and welfare effects of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The partial trade effect of APEC is evaluated via PPML method firstly. By constructing the counterfactual equations using exact hat algebra, this paper simulates the general equilibrium trade and welfare effects of APEC based on the structural gravity model. Empirical and simulative results reveal that APEC increases the trade flows of its members significantly and improve the general equilibrium trade and welfare effects.
